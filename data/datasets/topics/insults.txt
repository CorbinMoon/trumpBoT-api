It makes me feel so good to hit "sleazebags" back -- much better than seeing a psychiatrist (which I never have!)
Isn't it crazy that people of little or no talent or success can be so critical of those whose accomplishments are great with no retribution
I am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects. Whenever I tweet, some call it a tirade..totally dishonest!
I went to Wharton, made over $8 billion, employ thousands of people & get insulted by morons who can’t get enough of me on twitter...!
When someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more. This has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life!
How come every time I show anger, disgust or impatience, enemies say I had a tantrum or meltdown—stupid or dishonest people?
Isn't it crazy, I'm worth billions of dollars, employ thousands of people, and get libeled by  moron bloggers who can't afford a suit! WILD.
It’s amazing that people can say such bad things about me but if I say bad things about them, it becomes a national incident.
