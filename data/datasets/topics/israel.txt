I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance....
....between our two countries. I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!

Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota won‚Äôt stand for this).
‚ÄúThank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him....
....like he‚Äôs the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God...But American Jews don‚Äôt know him or like him. They don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that‚Äôs OK, if he keeps doing what he‚Äôs doing, he‚Äôs good for.....
Sorry, I don‚Äôt buy Rep. Tlaib‚Äôs tears. I have watched her violence, craziness and, most importantly, WORDS, for far too long. Now tears? She hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!
House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it and the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!
Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib‚Äôs grandmother. She doesn‚Äôt have to see her now!
Israel was very respectful and nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her ‚Äúgrandmother.‚Äù As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded and loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!
Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!
It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel and all Jewish people, and there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!
....except for those stated by me, and ‚Äúreams of paper‚Äù were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean and belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same, that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel and our Country!
....Most importantly you have led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy, freedom, and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!
Congratulations to Bibi Netanyahu on becoming the longest serving PM in the history of Israel. Under your leadership, Israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy....
I don‚Äôt believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party, but are weak and insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!
 So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel‚Ä¶

So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today‚Äôs vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen. If you really want to see statements, look at the horrible things they said about our Country, Israel, and much more. They are now the top, most...
The Democrat Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, and yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party. Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro-terrorist and public.....
The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four ‚Äúprogressives,‚Äù but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!
....They are anti-Israel, pro Al-Qaeda, and comment on the 9/11 attack, ‚Äúsome people did something.‚Äù Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders, which means drugs, crime, human trafficking, and much more....
‚ÄúWe all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of Communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own Country, they‚Äôre calling the guards along our Border (the Border Patrol Agents) Concentration Camp Guards, they accuse people who support Israel as doing it for the Benjamin‚Äôs,....
....What does it mean for America to have free Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants, no criminalization of coming into our Country - See how that works for controlling Immigration! They talk about Israel like they‚Äôre a bunch of thugs, not victims of the entire region. They wanted...
If Democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular and unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S.
When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them and their horrible and disgusting actions!
So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion. Whenever confronted, they call their adversaries, including Nancy Pelosi, ‚ÄúRACIST.‚Äù Their disgusting language.....

Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do!
Today marks the one-year anniversary of the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. Our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with Israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth.
Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said, and says?
Once again, Israel faces a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. We support Israel 100% in its defense of its citizens....
....To the Gazan people ‚Äî these terrorist acts against Israel will bring you nothing but more misery. END the violence and work towards peace - it can happen!
Wishing a Happy Passover to all those celebrating in America, Israel, and around the world! 
Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!
Spoke to Bibi Netanyahu to congratulate him on a great and hard-fought win. The United States is with him and the People of Israel all the way!

Very productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos, Switzerland! WEF18 
...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?
I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem... 
Dem Senator Schumer hated the Iran deal made by President Obama, but now that I am involved, he is OK with it. Tell that to Israel, Chuck!

President Obama, I have an idea! Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.
Obama sent weapons through Benghazi to ISIS yet he is holding up shipments to Israel. What is he thinking?
Wow, Obama really put it to Israel by canceling flights there. This puts them at a tremendous disadvantage. Tourism and more will just stop.
Obama betrays Israel yet again, our strongest ally in the Middle East. He will recognize Hamas, breaking long standing US policy.
I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election. He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAEL-AND ALWAYS WILL BE
